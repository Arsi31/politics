<h2>FOR A BETTER AND DEVELOPED ETHIOPIA</h2>

<p> Ethiopia is a country where nations and nationalities have a common value and visions which
the want to develop together <br> We Ethiopians need and also deserve democracy. Democracy is not for us an alien idea. When it was foreign to many peoples and countries, we lived under and governed by our democratic Gadaa system becoming an example on to the world. Today, for us building democracy is an existential matter than it is to any other country. <br> We defend Ethiopia </p>
